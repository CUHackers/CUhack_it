          	<div class="panel">
          	  <p>A hackathon is a 24 hour long event where students from different disciplines come
          	    together in small teams to work on real projects. The purpose of a hackathon is to have
          	    students learn about idea development and product design by being provided resources
          	    like hardware, workshops, and mentors. Hackathons are ultimately a collaborative space
          	    where creativity is encouraged and self-confidence can be obtained through hands on
          	    learning.</p>

          	<div class="panel">
          	  <p>CUhackit will be held in the Watt Family Innovation Center at Clemson University. You
          	    can expect a large commonspace for announcements and community hacking, medium rooms for
          	    workshops, individual rooms for team concentration, and a separate area for sleep. We
          	    will also feature the Clemson Makerspace and the Immersive Space.</p>
