            <div class="panel">
              <p>A hackathon is a 24 hour long event where students from different disciplines come
                together in small teams to work on real projects. The purpose of a hackathon is to have
                students learn about idea development and product design by being provided resources
                like hardware, workshops, and mentors. Hackathons are ultimately a collaborative space
                where creativity is encouraged and self-confidence can be obtained through hands on
                learning.</p>
            </div>
            <button class="accordion">Where is CUhackit?</button>
            <div class="panel">
              <p>CUhackit will be held in the Watt Family Innovation Center at Clemson University. You
                can expect a large commonspace for announcements and community hacking, medium rooms for
                workshops, individual rooms for team concentration, and a separate area for sleep. We
                will also feature the Clemson Makerspace and the Immersive Space.</p>

                students at any level.</p>
