  Commit changes often, we have version control for bad additions, but no
  way to recoup lost work if it isn't saved.

  For things which need to be worked on regarding the website, look under
  "issues" in the navigation bar of this GitHub page. 

  I sincerely apologize for the state of the code, I will continue commenting
  and cleaning as I acquire the knowledge to do so. Any help is always appreciated
  as this \(everything about most all of this\) is new to me.
