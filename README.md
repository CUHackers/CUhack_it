# CU Hackathon Splash-Page
### Sorry for formatting/other weirdness
  
  Commit changes often, we have version control for bad additions, but no
  way to recoup lost work if it isn't saved.

  For things which need to be worked on regarding the website, look under
  "issues" in the navigation bar of this GitHub page. 

  For things which need to be done, make an issue if not there
