# CU Hackathon Splash-Page

## Installation

You only need to build the css, then push to gh-pages!

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm build

```
### CURRENT PRIMARY GOALS

  We need to aim to provide a better readme so that it is possible for any
future team members to inherit the website and be immediately at home or to
have the tools to find necessary information.

#### TO THIS END
##### Descriptive Comments
  All code must be meticulously and descriptively commented. We've all heard
it from our teachers, but we must strive to exemplify good commenting practices.
Comments should not be:

```c
int foo = 4; // Set variable foo to four
```
   However, a brief message of the usage for the variable would be a good use of 
text:

```c
//  number of loops for bar_loop
int bar = 4; 
```

##### Comment As You Go
 
  Commenting is both a lost art and a process. Comment as you code or it will
become backed up and will never be completed.

##### Descriptive Names

  Names should be enough to approximate the use of a variable. It is not a
replacement for comments, but should allow the comments to add more clarity
to the variable's use. 

To continue from:

```c 
//  number of loops for bar_loop
int bar = 4;
```

If bar controls a loop, a better name may be:

```c
// Controls loops to set display of foo
int num_bar_loops = 4;
```
