# H1 CU Hackathon Splash-Page
# H3 Sorry for formatting/other weirdness

This is my first attempt at a real readme, please bear with me on this.

  This splash page, so far, is made in React, a javascript framework.
  That said: I do not really know what I am doing, and this is more or 
  less what I was able to learn about react in a day. The code is sloppy,
  but it more or less works.

  This app was made in create-react-app. In order to run it, clone the 
  repository into a directory where you want it, navigate to it, and run
  "npm start". This will launch a web browser with the current version of 
  the website.

  Commit changes often, we have version control for bad additions, but no
  way to recoup lost work if it isn't saved.

  For things which need to be worked on regarding the website, look under
  "issues" in the navigation bar of this GitHub page. 

    I sincerely apologize for the state of the code, I will continue commenting
  and cleaning as I acquire the knowledge to do so. Any help is always appreciated
  as this (everything about most all of this) is new to me.

CUHackit Landing Page Github

This is my first attempt at starting a git project hope it works. This is where All code changes/additions/etc should be put for the CUHackit splash page. I'm not entirely sure how to use this program, however, if anyone needs, a friend of mine did a good git rundown which I can try to put somewhere in here. 

I guess basic things are: Try to work in a branch of the Master, changes can be pulled to the master as needed.

I started this project using the Create-React-App program as somewhere along the line I was told we were going with react. 
That said, to see changes/run the program, navigate to the main directory for the project and run "npm start", 
this should boot a web browser to localhost:3000 with the active parts of the app in it. 

I plan on updating quite a bit of the code base later tonight and tomorrow, but I am also very new to react, sorry for the crap formatting.
