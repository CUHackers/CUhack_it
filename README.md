CUHackit Landing Page Github

This is my first attempt at starting a git project hope it works. This is where All code changes/additions/etc should be put for the CUHackit splash page. I'm not entirely sure how to use this program, however, if anyone needs, a friend of mine did a good git rundown which I can try to put somewhere in here. 

I guess basic things are: Try to work in a branch of the Master, changes can be pulled to the master as needed.

I started this project using the Create-React-App program as somewhere along the line I was told we were going with react. 
That said, to see changes/run the program, navigate to the main directory for the project and run "npm start", 
this should boot a web browser to localhost:3000 with the active parts of the app in it. 

I plan on updating quite a bit of the code base later tonight and tomorrow, but I am also very new to react, sorry for the crap formatting.
