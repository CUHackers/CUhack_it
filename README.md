    This splash page, so far, is made in React, a javascript framework.
  That said: I do not really know what I am doing, and this is more or 
  less what I was able to learn about react in a day. The code is sloppy,
  but it more or less works.

    This app was made in create-react-app. In order to run it, clone the 
  repository into a directory where you want it, navigate to it, and run
  "npm start". This will launch a web browser with the current version of 
  the website.

    Commit changes often, we have version control for bad additions, but no
  way to recoup lost work if it isn't saved.

    For things which need to be worked on regarding the website, look under
  "issues" in the navigation bar of this GitHub page. 

    I sincerely apologize for the state of the code, I will continue commenting
  and cleaning as I acquire the knowledge to do so. Any help is always appreciated
  as this (everything about most all of this) is new to me.
